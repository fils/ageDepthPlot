# Age Depth Plot (ADP)

> A simple age depth plotting GUI in Java developed under the CHRONOS effort

## Background
This is an initial commit of ADP from the old source code with a gradle build script.  I will be working to clean up the code and make the system more available for others to contribute to. 


## Building
The code can be built using gradle via:

	./gradlew clean shadowJar
	
This will create an executable JAR file in ``build/libs/ADP-2.0-all.jar``
